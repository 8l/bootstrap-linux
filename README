    This is a complete, self-bootstrapping musl-based Linux system
It contains nothing more than Linux, Perl, Busybox, Binutils, GCC, GNU
Make, and GNU sed. I haven't attempted to minimize the configuration
of these (yet), merely the package set. The programs get
static-linked, but musl does install a dynamic linker, and GCC should
be able to link programs against it.

    To build this from a non-musl Linux system, you will need to
execute ./bootstrap.sh. This will build musl and use the musl-gcc
script to link all the programs against it, placing the result in
./out/. To build from a musl Linux system, simply execute
./build.sh. This does much the same as bootstrap.sh, but it uses the
system's native C compiler for the build.

    ./make_fs.sh can be used to generate a bootable ext2 filesystem
from the out directory. To use it, you will need the "genext2fs"
program installed. If you don't feel like using it, you can just copy
the files onto a filesystem of your choice and boot it.

    Only the version of GCC is chosen for any particular reason. I
have opted for GCC 4.2.4, which is the last version of GCC that has no
external dependencies on libraries.
